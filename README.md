# Discord-Account-Backup
It was made with Turkish language support in order to quickly save the information of your Discord account. If there is a request, I can do it in other languages.

This can be useful as Discord can ban you at any time for an unreliable reason.

**4 Features:**
1. Save your friends
2. Register servers (Creates a permanent invite link for all servers)
3. Add registered friends
4. Join registered servers
